# Music Company Data Analysis

## Description:

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a music company's database using SQL. The objective is to gain valuable insights into the company's operations, track the performance of artists, and understand customer preferences. The database comprises multiple interconnected tables, allowing to query and analyze various aspects of the music business.
